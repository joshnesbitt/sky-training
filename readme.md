* Intermediate
* Advanced


### Twitter Gem

TODO.


### Twitter Interface

Using the gem built in the last project, you should write a simple web interface to searching Twitter. It should:

* Display a search box allowing users to enter search terms
* Make a request to Twitter with that query
* Display the resulting tweets on the page
* Allow those tweets to be favourited / unfavourited by the current user

TODO


## Workshops

There are currently no workshops planned.
