# Twitter Consumer - Intermediate

Create an application which takes input from a user (in the form of a search query) and returns a collection of matching tweets.

You should make use of:

* Sinatra
* The Twitter API
* Basic testing

You will not be judged on the design of the application, just functional aspects.

A solution for this exercise is available on the `solutions` branch.
