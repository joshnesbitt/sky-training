# Twitter Consumer

The Twitter consumer projects cover interfacing with the Twitter API, with varied levels of interaction depending on the difficulty level.

Using the gem built in the last project, you should write a simple web interface to searching Twitter. It should:

* Display a search box allowing users to enter search terms
* Make a request to Twitter with that query
* Display the resulting tweets on the page
* Allow those tweets to be favourited / unfavourited by the current user

Levels:

* [Beginner](1-beginner/readme.md)
* [Intermediate](2-intermediate/readme.md)
* [Advanced](3-advanced/readme.md)
