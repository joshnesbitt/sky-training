# Twitter Consumer - Advanced

Create an application which lists a users timeline. Tweets should be able to be favourited and retweeted from this application.

You should make use of:

* Sinatra
* The Twitter API
* Authentication
* Sessions
* Basic testing

You will not be judged on the design of the application, just functional aspects.

A solution for this exercise is available on the `solutions` branch.
